				<h3>Who is Spider-Man</h3>
				<p>
					Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, a teenager (or young adult depending on the story) who gained incredible abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These abilities include superhuman strength, agility, and the ability to cling to surfaces. He also has a "spider-sense" that warns him of danger.  Armed with these powers and his self-made web-shooters, Spider-Man fights crime in New York City, balancing his heroic duties with the everyday struggles of a young person. .
				</p>
				<h3>Is there more than one?</h3>
				<p>
					
While the name Spider-Man is most synonymous with Peter Parker, the web-slinging hero isn't alone. The Marvel universe operates on a concept called the multiverse, containing countless alternate realities. Within these realities exist numerous characters who've gained spider-like powers, becoming unique Spider-Men (or Women) like Miles Morales, a teenager with bio-electrokinesis alongside his spider-powers. There are even alternate versions of Peter Parker himself, some facing different life choices or gaining new abilities. This vast array of Spider-heroes, each with their own stories and universes, makes the web of Spider-Man truly expansive..
				</p>
				<h3>When did he first appear?</h3>
				<p>
					Spider-Man first swung into the world of comics in August 1962.  He made his debut in the anthology comic book  Amazing Fantasy #15.
				</p>
				<h3>The Creators of Spider-Man</h3>
				<p>
					Spider-Man was created by a collaborative effort between two comic book legends:

Stan Lee:  A writer, editor, and mastermind behind many of Marvel's iconic characters, Lee is credited with conceiving the idea for Spider-Man, wanting a relatable teenage hero.

Steve Ditko:  The artist who brought Spider-Man to life visually. Ditko designed the now-classic costume and helped flesh out the character's personality and struggles.
